Agentic AI — Trainable LMS/ERP Assistant
A modular, reproducible pipeline for fine-tuning a chat-optimized large language model (LLM) with tool-augmented trajectories for Learning Management Systems (LMS), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), and pedagogical domains.
The system leverages LoRA adapters for efficient specialization, supports CPU/MPS training for small-scale research, and uses a clean JSONL dataset schema for reproducibility.

1. Research Scope and Objectives
This project investigates:

Agentic reasoning through explicit tool calls and observation-feedback loops.

Low-resource specialization of open-weight LLMs for structured domain tasks.

Evaluation methodologies mixing exact match, substring match, and semantic similarity.

Target domains:

LMS: policy Q&A, attendance checks, syllabus retrieval.

ERP: ticket routing, data extraction from finance/HR systems.

Pedagogy: step-by-step math tutoring using algebraic reasoning datasets.

2. Repository Structure
Path	Purpose
train/	LoRA fine-tuning scripts, hyperparameters
evals/	Evaluation scripts, metrics
data/	SFT datasets (LMS/ERP + Algebraic Maths) and eval sets
agent/	Tool registry and execution
outputs/	LoRA adapters and tokenizer after training

3. Dataset Design and Schema
Format: JSONL, one object per line with:

instruction — Task description.

tools — Available tools (name, description, argument schema).

trajectory — Ordered steps: thought, action, observation.

final_answer — Final result.

  ],
  "final_answer": "x = 5"
}
Algebraic Maths Dataset

Size: 310 SFT training samples, 100 eval samples.

Categories:

Linear equations

Distributive property

Power and exponent rules

Quadratic factoring and quadratic formula

Systems of linear equations

Inequalities

Rational expressions

Word problems

Pedagogical focus: Explicit reasoning trajectories that simulate a tutor guiding a learner.

This dataset can be swapped in or combined with LMS/ERP datasets to test multi-domain agent capabilities.

4. Experimental Environment
Base model: TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0

LoRA params: r=16, alpha=32, dropout=0.05

Hardware: CPU or Apple MPS

Python: ≥ 3.12
(3.13 supported with tokenizers>=0.20.3)

5. Training Methodology
Data preparation

Clean JSONL (sed/grep).

Ensure no eval data in training set.

Fine-tuning

Attach LoRA adapters to projection layers.

Train with TRL’s SFTTrainer using structured prompts.

Multi-domain blending

Mix LMS/ERP and Algebraic Maths datasets for generalist behavior.

Use curriculum ordering for domain adaptation experiments.

6. Evaluation
Metrics:

Exact match (strict equality)

Contains (substring match)

Semantic similarity (cosine sim using sentence embeddings)

Eval datasets:

data/eval_samples.jsonl — LMS/ERP tasks.

data/algebra_eval_dataset.jsonl — Algebraic reasoning tasks.

7. Agent Tools
Example tools:

retrieve — Semantic search over LMS/ERP docs.

algebra — Symbolic manipulation steps for maths tutoring.

ticket_create — Create ERP/HR/IT support tickets.

8. Reproducibility Practices
Fixed seeds for random, numpy, and torch.

Versioned datasets and configs.

Separate train/eval sets.

Store all training artifacts in outputs/sft.

9. Roadmap
Integrate RAG with live LMS/ERP connectors.

Deploy inference API with OpenAI-compatible schema.

Add retrieval-grounded eval metrics.

Explore RLHF/DPO with human or synthetic preferences.

If you want, I can also add a "Dataset Composition & Mixing" section showing how to blend the LMS/ERP dataset with the Algebraic Maths dataset to produce a balanced multi-domain agent training set. Would you like me to add that next?

Do you want me to also **append a “Dataset Composition & Mixing” section** to this README so you can explain exactly how to blend your Algebraic Maths dataset with LMS/ERP data for multi-domain training? That would make it clearer for future readers or collaborators.
